# Defining Successful Videogames

## Variables
The 3 variables I selected for this initial analysis were genre, global sales, and Metacritic scores. 

Genre is a categorical variable that is given to a game to briefly describe what kind of gameplay you can expect. The global sales variable refers to the number of sales a game has generated, measured in the millions of units. Finally, the Metacritic score variable is a numerical value given to games by averaging the reviews of critics, weighting them based on the quality of the review and the reviewers stature and is measured on a scale of 0 to 100. 

## Genre Defines Videogames
Videogames use genre to quickly describe the type of gameplay features a player can expect to experience while playing it. For example, genres such as "Shooter" are used to describe videogames built around weapon-based gameplay such as the extremely popular "Call of Duty" series while games built around sport simulation features like EA's "FIFA" and "Madden NFL" games.

Here we created a table to visualize the differences in scores and number of reviewers by genre.

From the table we note that Action games are the most common having 72% more games than the 2nd place Sports genre. In the average critic score the range of is from 66.52-74.1 with an average score overall of 70.22. Additionally, the average user score ranged from 6.85-7.62 with an average overall score of 7.21. 

Moving on to critic and user count we find that average critic counts range from 23.16-37.04 and 33.64-387.71 for users.
