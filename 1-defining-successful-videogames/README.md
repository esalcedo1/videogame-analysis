# Defining Successful Videogames

## Variables
The 3 variables I selected for this initial analysis were genre, global sales, and Metacritic scores. 

Genre is a categorical variable that is given to a game to briefly describe what kind of gameplay you can expect. The global sales variable refers to the number of sales a game has generated, measured in the millions of units. Finally, the Metacritic score variable is a numerical value given to games by averaging the reviews of critics, weighting them based on the quality of the review and the reviewers stature and is measured on a scale of 0 to 100. 

## Genre Defines Videogames
Videogames use genre to quickly describe the type of gameplay features a player can expect to experience while playing it. For example, genres such as "Shooter" are used to describe videogames built around weapon-based gameplay such as the extremely popular "Call of Duty" series while games built around sport simulation features like EA's "FIFA" and "Madden NFL" games.

To begin with, we looked at the distribution of videogames across genres with average meta and user scores.
